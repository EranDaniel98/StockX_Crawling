How to run the project:
# After you have all installed run the file "main.py" and thats it, let the project work :)
# please notice that in the first question "Is it first run?" say no - because i've included the csv files i was working on.
  If you want to test everything from the beginning you have to delete all the .csv files and shoes_url_list.txt
